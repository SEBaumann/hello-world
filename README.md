# hello-world
An exercise to get started.

Wheee, this is more fun than a barrel of monkeys! That doesn't sound very fun, actually. I imagine the monkeys would be irritated, at best bored, all cooped up in a barrel like that. I'm assuming "cooped up" is the correct term for being confined to a barrel, since barrel-makers are called "coopers" (or is that wheel-makers? What are they, wheelwrights? Is that a word?). Anyway... Me & GitHub, everybody. We'll see how it compares to the whole monkey situation.
